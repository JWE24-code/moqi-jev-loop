/**
 * Find the installed Harness and make its `@deepseek-ai` packages resolvable

 * `node_modules` — but this plugin is linked from its checkout, so Node
 * resolves imports from the plugin's directory and never sees the anchor.
 * Linking the harness packages into the plugin's own `node_modules` closes the
 * gap, and keeps exactly one copy of each package (the harness's): a second
 * `@deepseek-ai/cordis` would be a different `Service` class.
